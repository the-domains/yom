Your Own Medicine (YOM) is a web-based portal for designing your own healthcare sessions.  You choose the location, people and treatments of your liking with doctors' guidance.

It's true that people are very similar in many ways, but not in all ways.  At YOM, we respect your individuality and could never treat you as just a number with a one-size-fits-all approach to treatment.  Healthy people have an active role in their health and have as much responsibility as their doctors when making health-related decisions.  

Schedule a session soon and see how invigorating the experience is when you are the one creating it! It truly is Your. Own. Medicine.
